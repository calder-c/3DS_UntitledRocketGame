# UntitledRocketGame

## Description
**A small retro-style arcade game made for CFW-enabled Nintendo 3DS devices.**
*Made using libctru and devkit-pro*


## Installation
Check the Releases page for the latest compiled .3dsx or .elf binaries.
There are [many tools](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/3DS:Installing_software) which allow for the usage of these binaries on 3DS, but all of them require [CFW](https://3ds.hacks.guide). You can also use an emulator such as [Citra](https://citra-emulator.com/) to emulate this project.
